# Freelance Loop – Internal Data Reference

These files are used for verification and formatting checks for the internship batches.  
Please review the clean structure file and the reference assets if you are processing Batch 17.

If any document fails validation, ensure you follow the instructions from HR.

Additional files will be pushed to this repository later.

Note: A reference image for internal formatting tests is stored in main directory.
